# Dodecahedral Menu

This project is an interactive web page that serves as a bridge to different facets of my creative and technical work. Inspired by the geometry of the dodecahedron, this interface is not only visually appealing but also embodies the search for harmony and beauty in design—principles that are reflected in my professional journey.

## Project Description

The **Dodecahedral Menu** offers a unique experience by allowing users to explore my various projects through buttons arranged in the structure of a dodecahedron. Each button leads to a link that represents a part of my work, from graphic design to programming, providing intuitive access to my creative contributions.
```javascript
const pentagonCenters = [
    new THREE.Vector3(0, -1.618, 1).multiplyScalar(radius),
    new THREE.Vector3(0, 1.618, 1).multiplyScalar(radius),
    new THREE.Vector3(0, 1.618, -1).multiplyScalar(radius),
    new THREE.Vector3(0, -1.618, -1).multiplyScalar(radius),
    new THREE.Vector3(1, 0, 1.618).multiplyScalar(radius),
    new THREE.Vector3(-1, 0, 1.618).multiplyScalar(radius),
    new THREE.Vector3(-1, 0, -1.618).multiplyScalar(radius),
    new THREE.Vector3(1, 0, -1.618).multiplyScalar(radius),
    new THREE.Vector3(1.618, 1, 0).multiplyScalar(radius),
    new THREE.Vector3(-1.618, 1, 0).multiplyScalar(radius),
    new THREE.Vector3(1.618, -1, 0).multiplyScalar(radius),
    new THREE.Vector3(-1.618, -1, 0).multiplyScalar(radius)
];


### Geometric Inspiration

The choice of the dodecahedron is not casual. Plato considered this figure a symbol of the divine, and its mystical structure translates into the complexity and depth of creativity. While calculating the position of each vertex of the dodecahedron, I discovered that the values relate to **phi**, the golden ratio—a principle that has guided artists and mathematicians throughout history in their pursuit of aesthetic perfection.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Basic structure of the page.
- **CSS**: Visual styles for an appealing experience.
- **JavaScript**: Interactivity and logic of the dodecahedron using Three.js, a library that enables 3D graphics in the browser.

## Future of the Project

This project is still a work in progress. The links are placeholders and will be updated with final links that reflect my current projects. My goal is to create a smooth and functional platform that invites visitors to discover my work and interact with it meaningfully.

## Conclusion

The **Dodecahedral Menu** is not just a website; it is a representation of my journey as a technical artist. Through the fusion of art, design, and technology, I aim to create experiences that not only inform but also inspire.
